# Neuro-evolution-of-augmented-topologies



The project focuses on applying the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm to evolve neural network structures in three environments from the Gymnasium library: CartPole, Pendulum, and Acrobot. The goal is to investigate which network architectures and activation functions evolve in response to different control tasks. The project also analyzes the advantages and limitations of graph-based approaches compared to traditional FeedForward networks and explores the possibility of transforming evolved networks into simpler, matrix-based representations.
