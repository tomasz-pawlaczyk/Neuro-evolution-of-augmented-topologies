# Neuro-evolution-of-augmented-topologies



This project applies the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm to evolve neural network structures in three Gymnasium environments: CartPole, Pendulum, and Acrobot. It explores how architectures and activation functions adapt to different control tasks and compares graph-based networks with traditional FeedForward models, considering ways to simplify evolved networks into matrix-based forms.
